# Lemon Disease Detector

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.19428847.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19428847)

A Bi-model Deep Learning Architecture to detect the disease of Lemon Leaves using `Convolutional Neural Networks`.

The models are also available on [HuggingFace Models](https://huggingface.co/IshaqueJunejo/Lemon-Disease-Detector).

You can try using the model pipeline yourself from the [Gradio Space on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/IshaqueJunejo/Lemon-Disease-Detection).

## Architecture

Architecture is based on 2 `Convolutional Neural Networks`.

First one is a `Binary Classification Model` that can tell if a given image is a *Lemon Leaf* or *Not*. The Image is passed to second model only if it is a *Lemon Leaf*.

Second model is a `Multi-Class Classifier` that tells the likelihood of the given image of Lemon Leaf having each *disease* and of being *healthy*.

Both models are based of `MobileNetV2` for Transfer Learning, as there was limited number of images to train a model from scratch.

You can also have a look at the [Evaluation and Metrics](core/Evaluation-and-Metrics.md).

If you want to train these models yourself, you can read [Reproducibility Procedure](core/Reproducibility.md).

If you want to have a look at the real-world behaviour of this pipeline, you can read the [Field Test Analysis](field-test/analysis.md).

You can also have a look at the [Progress Log](core/Progress-Log.md) for a glimpse of failures encountered on the way.

## How to use

To use this project, you will have to run it locally on your machine, or you can use the [Gradio Space on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/IshaqueJunejo/Lemon-Disease-Detection).

- To run it locally, first clone this repository.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/IshaqJunejo/Lemon-Disease-Detector.git
```
- Go to the `Lemon-Disease-Detector/api/` directory and run the API.
``` bash
cd Lemon-Disease-Detector/api/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
- Open a new terminal session, and host a server for the frontend-client.
``` bash
cd Lemon-Disease-Detector/web/
python -m http.server
```
- Open a Browser, and run the frontend to test the project by opening `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, upload an image, and click **Analyze**.

#### Optional

You can change the `web/static/script.js`, by replacing `127.0.0.1:7860/predict` to `<your-ip-address>:7860/predict`, if you want to try it on more than one device in your local network.
